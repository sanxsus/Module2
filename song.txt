Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink

She floats like a niccy rush but she stings like a B-flat
The Blond-o-Sonic Shimmer Trap
And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones
And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
